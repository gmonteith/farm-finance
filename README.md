## Description:
This is a **DRAFT** of a pdf called farm-finance.pdf

The document is still very much a draft but it is regularly worked on. The
document covers the basic mathematics of finance and how to use this
information to make better capital allocation decisions.

The document has been written using the groff document formatting system with
the ms macro package and the preprocessors eqn, tbl, pic and grap.

## Installation:
I use a Debian system so I will presume that if your system is different you
can follow along from the Debian instructions.

You will require groff and grap:

`sudo apt-get	install groff grap`

---

### Optional Packages:
You will also require a pdf viewer, I use both evince and zathura:

`sudo apt-get install evince zathura`

---

## Usage
To view the entire document, from inside the directory where you have
downloaded the repo,  you can simply type:

`. create-pdf; evince farm-finance-draft.pdf`

---

### Workflow When Editing:
The *master-wip.ms* file exists because the entire document is rather large,
cumbersome and slow to produce for editing individual files.

Vim is my preferred text editor and I typically have a vertically split window
with the chapter/appendix/file I am working on in one window and the
*master-wip.ms* file open in the other. The *master-wip.ms* file is uncommented
to print the file I am editing, and any other files I maybe interested in.

I run the command below inside vim to create a pdf file called *worktest.pdf*
in the *tmp* directory in my home folder. If you do not have this directory you
can either create it or edit the *create-wip-pdf* file to direct the output to
a different location.

`!. create-wip-pdf`

Each time a change is made to the chapter/appendix/file it is saved and then
the command above is rerun.

The reason the *master-wip.ms* file is required is that the macro files,
*macro/format.tmac*, *macro/equation.tmac* and *macro/pic.tmac* are only
sourced in the master files  and not in the individual chapters/appendices
files.

You could of course source these files in each individual chapter or data file
but that would require more maintenance.

A separate window can be used to open the pdf which will automatically refresh
on each update to the underlying pdf document:

`zathura --fork ~/tmp/worktest.pdf; exit`

---

### Bugs:
There are some blank pages between the cover sheet and the table of contents.
This is obviously an unwanted feature, however, I am not sure exactly what is
causing it. I think it may be the interaction between the BT, PT and TC macros
within the ms macro package. I have not had time to give it the consideration
it deserves at this time. Sorry
